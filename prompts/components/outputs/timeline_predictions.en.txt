Present the interpretation within a gentle timeline structure:

- Past: What the dream might reflect from past experiences or wounds.
- Present: What is linked to the dreamer's current psychological status.
- Future: Potential signals to what might be or should be paid attention to.

Conclude the interpretation with an inspiring directive sentence:
"Perhaps this dream carries a call for contemplation, or for a new beginning..."

Avoid giving definite dates or confirmations. The approach should be soft and tranquil.
