This methodology relies on analyzing the dream according to five stages:

1. **Superficial Description**: Identifying the presented symbols and the place and time of the dream.
2. **Emotional Analysis**: What were the feelings that dominated the dreamer during the dream? Fear? Astonishment? Reassurance?
3. **Personal Context**: Linking the symbols to situations or pressures in the dreamer's real life.
4. **Temporal Interpretation**: Does the dream indicate an upcoming crisis? Or overcoming an old obstacle?
5. **Inspirational touch**: Give the dreamer a gentle hint that guides them to their insight or direction.

Focus on a mix of psychological analysis and spiritual contemplation, without issuing harsh judgments or absolute predictions.
